The Casper algorithm is implemented base on the sample code provided by Australian National University,
algorithm/codes including normalization, plotting loss diagram and plotting
error matrix and printing epoch/loss and accuracy has been copied directly from the COMP4660
Lab material. Some of which, as denoted in the lab material, is provided by UCI originally serve
as an example for the classfication of the glass dataset

The Genetic algorithm code were based on the COMP4660 lab material and the DEAP documentation.

The implementation of the autoencoder was directly copied from https://medium.com/pytorch/implementing-an-autoencoder-in-pytorch-19baa22647d1, with minor changes.

Other codes however, written entirely on my own.
